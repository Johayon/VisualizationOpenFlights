##Datasets
As part of this project we are going to leverage 3 datasets containing the airports, airlines and routes over the world.

##Refined Problem Statement
Here are a couple of questions we will try to be answer through the visualizations:

| Audience  						| Question / Problem  											|
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Governments / Airport companies   | What are the incoming/outgoing routes for a given airport?   	|
| Governments / airlines 			| What are the biggest hubs?								    |   
| Governments/Travel Agencies	    | What are the biggest airlines in terms of traffic for the short, medium and long haul flights? |
| Airport companies					| An airline is in bankruptcy: how many routes do we lose, what is the percentage of workload loss for a given airport?|
| Governments / Airline companies   |  An airport is not available – what is the impact for the airlines? |
| All | What are airports/airlines main characteristics (country )|
